## Technology Stack Justification

### Core Framework: Next.js 15

**Justification**:

- **UI Development Efficiency**: Creating UI components with Next.js is streamlined and efficient, essential for rapid POC development
- **App Router Architecture**: Modern routing system provides better organization for API routes and component structure
- **Full-Stack Capabilities**: Single framework handles both frontend and backend API routes

### Language: TypeScript

**Justification**:

- **No Language Restrictions**: Assignment specifications didn't mandate specific language, allowing optimal choice
- **Developer Experience**: Superior IDE support, autocomplete, and error catching during development
- **Vercel AI SDK Compatibility**: Excellent TypeScript support for AI model integrations
- **Assistant UI Integration**: Native TypeScript support simplifies component development

### AI Model: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash

**Justification**:

- **Cost Effectiveness**: Free tier availability crucial for POC development and testing
- **Model Stability**: Proven reliability for structured text generation and tool usage
- **Performance Balance**: Good quality-to-cost ratio for interview assessment tasks
- **Fallback Strategy**: OpenAI GPT-4o available as premium option when needed

**Model Configuration** (`/src/lib/model.ts`):

```typescript
export const model = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
  ? openai("gpt-4o")
  : google("gemini-2.5-flash");
```

### AI Architecture: Tools-Based Approach

**Justification**:

- **Real Interview Mimicry**: Tools allow AI to make intelligent decisions like human interviewers

- **Quality Control**: Zod schemas ensure consistent, structured outputs from AI tools
- **Professional Flow**: Tools enable proper interview pacing and comprehensive evaluation

### Data Storage: No Database (Memory-Only)

**Justification**:

- **Assignment Requirements**: No specific requirement for persistent data storage mentioned in assignment specifications
- **POC Simplicity**: In-memory storage using JavaScript memory only - no file persistence or database needed
- **Stateless Sessions**: Interview sessions exist only in memory during conversation - each session is completely independent
- **Development Speed**: Eliminates any storage setup complexity, allowing focus purely on core AI functionality and interview logic
- **Deployment Simplicity**: No database, file system, or persistence infrastructure needed for POC demonstration
- **Question Bank**: 16 curated questions stored as TypeScript constants in memory (`/src/lib/question-bank.ts`)

## AI Interview Flow - 6 Phases

The system implements a **6-phase structured interview process** as defined in `/src/app/api/chat/route.ts`:

### Phase 1: Self-Introduction

- Alex Morgan introduces himself as Excel interviewer
- Explains 3-4 question interview process
- Sets professional, encouraging tone
- Triggers automatically when user starts with "Hello"

### Phase 2: Information Gathering

**Required Data Collection**:

- Full name of the candidate
- Current role/job title
- Years of Excel experience
- Professional background/industry
- Relevant qualifications, certifications, specialized skills

**Behavior**: Persistent data collection with follow-up questions until complete

### Phase 3: Intelligent Questioning (Tool-Driven)

**Process Flow**:

```
User Response → getNextQuestion Tool → Question Selection → Present Question
     ↓                                                           ↑
Candidate Response → evaluateResponse Tool → Feedback & Decision ↗
```

**Tool Integration**:

- **getNextQuestion**: Analyzes performance, selects appropriate difficulty
- **evaluateResponse**: Provides immediate feedback, determines next action

### Phase 4: Response Evaluation

**Features**:

- Response quality assessment (Excellent, Good, Partial, Unclear, Incorrect)
- Immediate constructive feedback generation
- Follow-up question determination (max 2 per question)
- Interview flow management decisions

### Phase 5: Question Tracking & Flow Management

**Logic**:

- Tracks question count (aims for 3-4 total)
- Updates performance summary
- Manages used question IDs
- Determines when to proceed to final assessment

### Phase 6: Comprehensive Assessment

**generateFeedback Tool**:

- Reviews entire conversation
- Generates structured assessment report
- Includes candidate profile, technical ratings, and recommendations
- Provides final comprehensive evaluation
