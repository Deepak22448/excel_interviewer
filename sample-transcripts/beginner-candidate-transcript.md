### Question 1: Basic SUM Function

**Alex Morgan**: Here's your first question:

How would you calculate the sum of values in cells A1 through A10? Please explain the formula you would use.

Feel free to ask if you need any clarification or hints!

**Rahul Sharma**: Use `=SUM(A1:A10)` in Excel. This formula adds all values in cells A1 to A10.

### Question 2: VLOOKUP Function

**Alex Morgan**: Here's your next question:

You have a table with employee names in column A and their salaries in column B (rows 2-100). How would you find the salary of a specific employee using their name?

Let me know if you need any hints or clarification!

**Rahul Sharma**: Use `=VLOOKUP("EmployeeName", A2:B100, 2, FALSE)` in Excel. Replace "EmployeeName" with the specific employee's name. This formula searches for the name in column A and returns the corresponding salary from column B. The FALSE parameter ensures an exact match.

**Alex Morgan**: Your response is spot on, Rahul! Using the VLOOKUP function with an exact match is the right approach to find the salary of a specific employee. It's great to see you are comfortable with lookup operations.

### Question 3: IF Function for Conditional Logic

**Alex Morgan**: Here's your next question:

How would you create a formula that shows "Pass" if a student's score is 60 or above, and "Fail" if below 60?

If you need any hints or clarification, feel free to ask!

**Rahul Sharma**: Use `=IF(A1>=60, "Pass", "Fail")` in Excel. Replace A1 with the cell containing the student's score. This formula checks if the score is 60 or higher and returns "Pass"; otherwise, it returns "Fail".

*[Tool Used: evaluateResponse - Quality: Excellent]*

**Alex Morgan**: You've nailed it, Rahul! Using the IF function to assess whether a student's score meets the passing threshold is exactly right. You've demonstrated a good understanding of Excel's conditional logic. Well done!

**Alex Morgan**: Here's your final question:

You need to calculate the total sales for "Product A" from a sales data table. The product names are in column C and sales amounts in column D (rows 2-500). What formula would you use?

Let me know if you need any hints or clarification!

**Alex Morgan**: Hey Rahul, how would you approach this question?

**Rahul Sharma**: Use `=SUMIF(C2:C500, "Product A", D2:D500)` in Excel. This formula sums the values in column D where column C equals "Product A".

*[Tool Used: evaluateResponse - Quality: Excellent]*
