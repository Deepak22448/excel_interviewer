### Question 1: Basic SUM Function

**Alex Morgan**: Here's your first question:

**How would you calculate the sum of values in cells A1 through A10? Explain the formula you would use.**

Take your time to explain your approach!

**Joel Smith**: I previously answered this question for you, and the formula remains the same. Use `=SUM(A1:A10)` in Excel. This formula adds all numeric values in cells A1 through A10. For example, if A1:A10 contains {10, 20, 30, ..., 100}, it returns 550. Non-numeric values are ignored.

*[Tool Used: evaluateResponse - Quality: Excellent]*

**Alex Morgan**: Great job, Joel! Your explanation was spot on, and your example was helpful. You're clearly comfortable with the basic arithmetic functions in Excel.

Let's move on to the next question.

### Question 2: COUNTA Function

**Alex Morgan**: Here's your next question:

**How would you count the number of cells that contain data in a range B1:B50?**

Feel free to explain the formula or approach you would use!

**Joel Smith**: Use `=COUNTA(B1:B50)` in Excel. This formula counts all non-empty cells in the range B1 to B50, including text, numbers, and errors.

*[Tool Used: evaluateResponse - Quality: Excellent]*

**Alex Morgan**: Well done, Joel! You correctly identified the use of the `COUNTA` function and explained it clearly. Excellent work!

Let's proceed to the next question.

### Question 3: SUMIF Function for Data Analysis

**Alex Morgan**: Here's your next question:

**You need to calculate the total sales for 'Product A' from a sales data table. The product names are in column C and sales amounts in column D (rows 2-500). What formula would you use?**

Please explain your approach!

**Joel Smith**: Use =SUMIF(C2:C500, "Product A", D2:D500) in Excel. This formula sums the values in column D where column C equals "Product A". For example, if C2:C500 contains "Product A" in rows 2 and 3 with sales amounts 100 and 200 in D2:D3, it returns 300.

*[Tool Used: evaluateResponse - Quality: Excellent]*

**Alex Morgan**: Excellent work, Joel! You correctly used the `SUMIF` function and provided a clear explanation and example. You're doing great!

Let's move on to the final question.

### Question 4: IF Function for Conditional Logic

**Alex Morgan**: Here's the final question:

**How would you create a formula that shows 'Pass' if a student's score is 60 or above, and 'Fail' if below 60?**

Feel free to walk through your approach!

**Joel Smith**: Use =IF(A1>=60, "Pass", "Fail") in Excel. Replace A1 with the cell containing the student's score. This formula returns "Pass" if the score is 60 or higher, otherwise "Fail". For example, if A1 is 75, it returns "Pass"; if 55, it returns "Fail".

*[Tool Used: evaluateResponse - Quality: Excellent]*

**Alex Morgan**: Fantastic, Joel! You've effectively used the `IF` function and provided clear examples. Your understanding of conditional formulas in Excel is excellent.

Now that we've completed all four questions, I'll compile a comprehensive assessment report. Just a moment, please.
